					<h4>About CSGO Win Big</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					CSGO Win Big is a new Counter-Strike: Global Offensive jackpot-style betting website. It is set apart from other websites, because it is fully open source. You can view the source code for the website <a href="https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig" target="_blank">here</a>, and view the source code for the Steam Bot that handles deposits and payouts <a href="https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig-SteamBot" target="_blank">here</a>. This website was created by, developed, and is run by Jordan Turley. If you have any questions about this website, <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/ztizzlegaming/" target="_blank">add me on Steam</a> and send me a message. And of course, good luck!

					<hr>

					The way it works is simple:
					<ol>
						<li>Deposit your skins by clicking the button in the top right</li>
						<li>Your tickets will be calculated. For example, if you deposit $1 of skins, you get 100 tickets; $10 gets you 1000 tickets. 1 cent is 1 ticket.</li>
						<li>When the pot reaches 100 skins, a winner will be randomly chosen, and ~98% of the skins will be send to you in a trade offer (Learn more about this in 'Rules and other information' below).</li>
					</ol>

					<hr>

					"Why was my trade offer decelined?" Your trade offer may have been declined because:
					<ul>
						<li>Your inventory is set to private.</li>
						<li>Your offer didn't meet the minimum bet of $1.</li>
						<li>Your offer was not a gift (you tried to get items from the bot instead of just giving).</li>
						<li>Your offer contained more than the 10 item limit.</li>
						<li>One or more of the items in your offer was not for CS: GO.</li>
						<li>Your offer contained an item that is not listed on the Steam Community Market (Learn more about this in 'RUles and other information' below).</li>
					</ul>

					<hr>

					Rules and other information:
					<ul>
						<li>At this time, item prices are fetched directly from the Steam Community Market. So, because of this, if an item is not listed on the Steam Market, then you are unable to bet that item.</li>
						<li>The pot can be a bit larger than 100 skins, depending on how many skins are in the last deposit.</li>
						<li>The site will keep about 2% of the skins in every pot, but no more than 5%. The amount taken will be as close to 2% as it can be, depending on the items in the pot, but will never be more than 5%. This is so that the staff of CSGO Win Big can keep the site running as best as it can, without having any annoying ads on the site.</li>
						<li>If you experience any lost items, such as depositing an item but not seeing it in the pot, or winning a pot but not receiving a trade offer, please submit a <a href="support.html">support ticket</a> and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</li>
